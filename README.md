# RaktDan
	An application to serve as a medium of network between blood donors and patients & hospitals. The app aims to simplify the process of blood donation by introducing a 	digital approach to the tradition model.


## Inspiration

	Our



## App Implementation Guide?
 * This app provides a platform to sign up as a potential blood donor or hospital authority.
 * A Voluntary Donor has to make an account on our app with some general information like:
    - Name(via Google Cloud)
    - Blood Group
    - Aadhar ID
    - Location [Manually].


 * On the other side, the one who needs blood, will push a request for blood unit through the hospital authority channel.

On raising a unit request the people nearby will receive requests as a notification incase they are interested to donate blood.


## Real time usecases of the project
