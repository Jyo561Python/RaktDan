# RaktDan
An application to serve as a medium of network between blood donors and patients & hospitals. The app aims to simplify the process of blood donation by introducing a digital approach to the tradition model.

## App Implementation Guide?
 * This app provides a platform to sign up as a potential blood donor or hospital authority.
 * A Voluntary Donor has to make an account on our app with some general information like:
    - Name
    - Age
    - Blood Group
    - Address
    - Gender
    - Location [Manually].


 * On the other side, the one who needs blood, will push a request for blood unit through the hospital authority channel.

On raising a unit request the people nearby will receive requests as a notification incase they are interested to donate blood.


## Real time usecases of the project

1) A medium of connection between Blood Donors and Patients.
   - This app will reduce the operations time of blood donation process and thus providing a more feasible approach.
2) Prevent wastage of blood
   - The app will have a huge impact on the wastage of blood units in medical colleges & hospitals as it can be a replacement for the storage based blood donation system.
